# Key Business Problems Solved

Enterprise Friction Points Solved

- âœ… CMS removes developer bottlenecks
- âœ… Personalized promotions at runtime
- âœ… Fast load via partial pre-rendering
- âœ… API simplification reduces backend strain

---

# Personalization Pipeline

Shopper Context at Runtime

- Middleware detects `source` param
- Guest user assigned context
- PDP fetches personalized promos
- Fully cacheable server-rendered promotions

```mermaid

    participant User

    participant Salesforce
    User->>Middleware: Request with source param
    Middleware->>Salesforce: Create guest user
    Middleware->>User: Guest token with Shopper Context
    User->>PDP: Fetch product with context token
    PDP->>Salesforce: Personalized promos
```

# Localization with Middleware

Middleware for Locale Control

- Auto-detect language (EN / FR)
- Locale applied before render
- Maximizes cache layer effectiveness

---

# Optimistic Cart State

Instant Cart Feedback

- Shared optimistic state provider
- Immediate UI reflection
- Custom cart fields reduce refetches
- Lean API payloads for fast response

---

# Handling SearchParams Without Going Fully Dynamic

Partial Pre-Rendering with Variants

- SearchParams handled at lower Suspense boundary
- Static PDP loads instantly
- Dynamic data streamed without full page re-render

```mermaid

# Sanity CMS: Editorial Empowerment

No More Developer Tickets for Merchandising

- Business teams manage:
  - Homepage merchandising
  - Carousels, banners, features
  - Site copy
- Decouples engineering from constant content updates

---

# Performance Stack

Performance From Every Layer

- ISR + middleware maximize cache hits
- Targeted API expansion â†’ leaner data
- Server components + Suspense optimize hydration
- Fluid Compute lowers backend costs

---

# Where This Can Go Next

Future Enhancements

- Registered user login + token refresh
- CMS-powered bundles & landing pages
- Salesforce-to-Sanity sync pipelines
- Deeper personalization via customer segments

---

# Key Takeaways

- Headless â‰  complex when architecture aligns to business needs
